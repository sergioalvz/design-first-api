# Developing design-first APIs

## Specification

Maybe one of the most important things when trying to implement your REST API by following a design-first approach is to choose a specification format which allows you to express API design choices before writing any single line of code.

Although even a PDF document could serve to achieve this goal, using a formal language in a machine-readable format may offer some of the following advantages:

* Have a **concise** and **common language** to express complex concepts
* Have a specification which could be **understood by other software** to generate: documentation, validations, clients and so on.

### Philosophy

* **Top-down**
* **Bottom-up**

### Options

* **[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)** (formerly **[Swagger](https://swagger.io/)**)
* **[API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)**
